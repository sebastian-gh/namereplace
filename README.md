namereplace can help to replace text in the name of files and directories inside a given directory. It has been tested on Mac OS X 10.6.8 and Mac OS X 10.7.5

For example, you want to replace the text "IMG_" in the filenames IMG_001, IMG_002, IMG_003... with the text "MyImage_", resulting in new filenames MyImage_001, MyImage_002, MyImage_003...
