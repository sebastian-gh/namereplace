namereplace is a Qt-Application that searchs for a text in the name of files and directories inside a given directory and replaces it with a new text. It has been tested on Mac OS X 10.6.8, Mac OS X 10.7.5 and Mac OS X 10.11.6.

For example, you want to replace "IMG_" in the filenames IMG_001, IMG_002, IMG_003... with "MyImage_", resulting in new filenames MyImage_001, MyImage_002, MyImage_003.

The search is case-sensitive.
